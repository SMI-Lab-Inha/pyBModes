"""Name the floating-platform rigid-body modes.

For a free-free tower (``hub_conn = 2``) carrying a
:class:`~pybmodes.io.bmi.PlatformSupport`, the low modes are the
platform rigid-body modes — surge / sway / heave / roll / pitch / yaw.
They are identifiable from the tower-base node's 6-DOF motion in the
eigenvector, weighted by the platform 6×6 inertia (which supplies the
mass / moment-of-inertia metric that makes a translation amplitude
comparable to a rotation amplitude).

The classifier is deliberately *conservative*: it names a mode only
when one platform DOF clearly dominates the base-node modal kinetic
energy. A flexible tower mode, or a strongly coupled / eigensolver-
rotated near-degenerate pair (surge≈sway, roll≈pitch), is left
``None`` rather than mislabelled — consistent with the project's
"only name what's unambiguous" stance. Empirically every genuine
rigid-body mode on the validated floating decks (OC3 Hywind, the
IEA-15 / IEA-22 / OC4 / UPSCALE samples) is overwhelmingly single-DOF
and is named; the first flexible bending pair and above stay ``None``.

# a large spectral gap on every validated deck (OC3 0.12→0.48 Hz,
# IEA-15 0.049→0.525 Hz). Only the lowest ``_N_RIGID`` modes are

    active_dofs : (ngd,) sorted global indices of the active DOFs

        to scatter the compact eigenvector back to full DOF size — the
        same expansion :func:`pybmodes.fem.normalize.extract_mode_shapes`
        performs.
    nselt : number of beam elements.

        DOF order (``PlatformND.mass`` from

        mass / inertia metric for the energy weighting.
